# AxelCrafts - Project for Stream 1 - Code Institute

This is a basic presentation website for my brother's business.

-   It has been created in Atom IDE & ParcelJS using HTML5, CSS3.
-   Media queries have been used for responsiveness
-   jQuery was used to animate the page.
-   Extra fonts have been added from Google Fonts and Font Awesome.

The website has a flat, clean and responsive interface. User interface is easy to understand and straight forward.
The navigation menu is fixed on the top of the page. All information is divided in separate Sections.
To navigate around the page you need to click/tap on the links.
ScrollSpy animates the website and makes it "scroll-down" to the section you clicked/tapped on.

"Home" section has a JavaScript Carousel that shows pictures with the main themes from artist's life.

"About" section tells us some basic info about artist

"Services" section shows what artist can offer to the people that would love to send the perfect gift to their love ones.

"Portofolio" section has information about all the work that artist has been done until now.

"Contact" section has a form that can be used to send an email to the website admins and the contact address.

The footer has social media links.

Note:
All the snippets code that was used as inspiration, their authors were mentioned in the specific files.
